# Wasabi Utils

This repository contains utilities for working with Wasabi cloud storage services.

## Configuration

To use these utilities, you need to create a configuration file with your Wasabi credentials.

1. Create a copy of `config.example` and name it `config` 
2. Fill in your actual Wasabi credentials in the `config` file

**IMPORTANT**: The `config` file containing your actual credentials is ignored by git for security reasons. Never commit your actual access keys or secret keys to version control.
